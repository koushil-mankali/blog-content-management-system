(3, 'Global Warming !!!', 'Global warming is the ongoing rise of the average temperature of the Earth\\\'s climate system.[1] It is a major aspect of climate change which, in addition to rising global surface temperatures,[2] also includes its effects, such as changes in precipitation.[3] While there have been prehistoric periods of global warming, observed changes since the mid-20th century have been unprecedented in rate and scale.[4]\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nObserved temperature from NASA[5] vs the 1850â€“1900 average as a pre-industrial baseline. The primary driver for increased global temperatures in the industrial era is human activity, with natural forces adding variability.[6]\\r\\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded that \\\"human influence on climate has been the dominant cause of observed warming since the mid-20th century\\\". These findings have been recognized by the national science academies of major nations and are not disputed by any scientific body of national or international standing.[7] The largest human influence has been the emission of greenhouse gases, with over 90% of the impact from carbon dioxide and methane.[8] Fossil fuel burning is the principal source of these gases, with agricultural emissions and deforestation also playing significant roles. Climate sensitivity to these gases is affected by feedbacks, such as loss of snow cover, increased water vapour, and melting permafrost.\\r\\n\\r\\nLand surfaces are heating faster than the ocean surface, leading to heat waves, wildfires, and the expansion of deserts.[9] Increasing atmospheric energy and rates of evaporation are causing more intense storms and weather extremes, damaging infrastructure and agriculture.[10] Surface temperature increases are greatest in the Arctic and have contributed to the retreat of glaciers, permafrost, and sea ice. Environmental impacts include the extinction or relocation of many species as their ecosystems change, most immediately in coral reefs, mountains, and the Arctic. Surface temperatures would stabilize and decline a little if emissions were cut off, but other impacts will continue for centuries, including rising sea levels from melting ice sheets, rising ocean temperatures, and ocean acidification from elevated levels of carbon dioxide.[11]\\r\\n\\r\\nSome effects of climate change\\r\\n\\r\\nEcological collapse possibilities. Bleaching has damaged the Great Barrier Reef and threatens reefs worldwide.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMitigation efforts to address global warming include the development and deployment of low carbon energy technologies, policies to reduce fossil fuel emissions, reforestation, forest preservation, as well as the development of potential climate engineering technologies. Societies and governments are also working to adapt to current and future global warming impacts, including ...', 2, 1, '2020-07-13 16:10:55', '5f0c878faef9dearth.jpg'),

(6, 'Latest Technology News', 'Technology (\\\"science of craft\\\", from Greek Ï„Î­Ï‡Î½Î·, techne, \\\"art, skill, cunning of hand\\\"; and -Î»Î¿Î³Î¯Î±, -logia[2]) is the sum of techniques, skills, methods, and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation. Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines to allow for operation without detailed knowledge of their workings. Systems (e.g. machines) applying technology by taking an input, changing it according to the system\\\'s use, and then producing an outcome are referred to as technology systems or technological systems.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe simplest form of technology is the development and use of basic tools. The prehistoric discovery of how to control fire and the later Neolithic Revolution increased the available sources of food, and the invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their environment. Developments in historic times, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale.\\r\\n\\r\\nTechnology has many effects. It has helped develop more advanced economies (including today\\\'s global economy) and has allowed the rise of a leisure class. Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products known as pollution and deplete natural resources to the detriment of Earth\\\'s environment. Innovations have always influenced the values of a society and raised new questions in the ethics of technology. Examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity, and the challenges of bioethics.\\r\\n\\r\\nPhilosophical debates have arisen over the use of technology, with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it. Neo-Luddism, anarcho-primitivism, and similar reactionary movements criticize the pervasiveness of technology, arguing that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and techno-progressivism view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the human condition.', 2, 1, '2020-07-13 16:14:14', '5f0c8856e2929technology.jpg');
